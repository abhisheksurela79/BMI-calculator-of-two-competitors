# BMI-calculator-of-two-competitors
Coding challenge: A JavaScript program that calculates BMI of two competitors with given data.

<h3>Calculate BMIs of 2 competitors and use objects to implement the
calculations. Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2</h3>

1. For each of them, create an object with properties
for their full name, mass, and height (Mark Miller
and John Smith)

2. Create  a 'calcBMI' method to calculate the BMI and
Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it
from the method.

3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI,
together with the first name and the respective BMI.

<strong>Example:</strong>
"John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's BMI (23.5)

TEST DATA: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall.
John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
